# Geotab IIC
- existing solutions don't leverage video telematics
- existing solutions don't have a focus on providing feedback and facilitating improvement
    - they mainly focus on passive monitoring, compared to iterative feedback/improvement
- existing solutions don't have a large focus on AI

We want to focus on establishing a path of improvement by providing dynamic and personalized feedback to drivers.


## Scoring

CSA scores are based on violations, however we can also quantify things that drivers are doing well by leveraging video telematics, and additionally compare them to the average across the entire fleet.
